How many ping pong balls can fit in a 747?

1. Find out the interior dimensions for a 747. The answer also depends if the space available is
limited to the cabin space. 
	Through a Google search the length of a 747 is 76.3m and the height is 19.4m.
2. Compute area of approximate volume of a 747. 
	76.3 * 19.4 = 1480.22 m^3
3. Find volume of ping pong ball. Assuming that the radius of the ping pong ball is 20mm, 
the volume is 1.0x10^(-9)m^3
4. Calculate how many ping pong balls needed to fill the 747 space (assuming 747 is completely
empty). 
	Volume of 747/Volume of Ping Pong ball= 1.48x10^(12) ping pong balls. 
5. The above is for an ideal. More accurate results could be made if the exact dimensions were
known.
